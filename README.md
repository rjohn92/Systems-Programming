# ‚öôÔ∏è Systems Programming in C (CNO/RE Track) ‚Äì Master Syllabus

## Overview

**Goal:**  
Learn to write, debug, and analyze C code that interfaces directly with the operating system.  
Gain practical skills for building, auditing, and reverse engineering tools, exploits, and system-level applications as required in CNO and RE roles.

---

## üéØ Audience

This course is designed for:
- Aspiring CNO analysts, vulnerability researchers, and offensive cyber professionals (entry to intermediate)
- Security engineers and DevOps/SREs transitioning into lower-level systems or RE work
- CS students or professionals who have **basic programming** experience but need hands-on systems/OS knowledge
- Anyone preparing for roles that involve exploit development, malware analysis, or advanced system debugging

---

## üèÅ Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you should **already be able to**:
- Write, debug, and compile basic C programs (variables, loops, functions, structs, arrays, pointers)
- Understand fundamental concepts of memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
- Use the Linux command line, `gcc`, and navigate/manipulate files/directories
- Use a basic debugger (gdb, lldb, or similar) to step through C code and view variables
- Read and edit text/code using a terminal editor (vim, nano, or VSCode with terminal)

**Recommended before starting:**  
- Complete a C Programming Fundamentals course or self-study syllabus (see: [Comprehensive C Syllabus](../C-Syllabus/README.md) or equivalent)

---

## üóùÔ∏è What Skill Level Is Expected?

- **Beginner-to-intermediate:**  
  This is *not* an "introduction to programming" course ‚Äî you should be comfortable with C syntax, pointers, and compiling simple programs.
- **You do NOT need to:**  
  - Have prior systems programming or reverse engineering experience
  - Know advanced OS internals (you will learn these here)
  - Have exploited real-world vulnerabilities before
- **You WILL be challenged to:**  
  - Write non-trivial, multi-file C programs
  - Debug and analyze memory/process issues
  - Use and interpret syscall traces, assembly listings, and OS-level tools

---

## üèóÔ∏è Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you‚Äôll be able to:
- Write C programs that use syscalls, manage processes, threads, files, and memory directly
- Analyze how your programs interact with the OS (and vice versa)
- Debug, trace, and analyze real binaries using modern tools (GDB, objdump, strace, Valgrind)
- Understand and find basic vulnerabilities, and build a foundation for CNO/RE tool development

## üóìÔ∏è Weekly Breakdown

---

### **Week 0: What Is Systems Programming?**
- Systems programming vs. app programming
- User space vs. kernel space
- What happens when you run a C program?
- *Lab:* Use `strace` to trace `ls`; draw a syscall flow diagram.

---

### **Week 1: Compilation, Linking, and the Process Model**
- Source to binary: preprocessing, compilation, linking
- Static vs. dynamic linking
- Anatomy of a Linux process: stack, heap, data, code
- *Lab:* Write, compile, and analyze a simple C binary with `objdump` and `readelf`.
- *Observable:* Identify `.text`, `.data`, and `.bss` sections in your binary.

---

### **Week 2: Processes and Program Execution**
- Fork/exec/wait: creating and managing processes
- Parent/child relationships, process hierarchy
- Zombie and orphan processes
- *Lab:* Write a C program that forks children, executes `ls`, and reaps orphans.
- *Observable:* Use `ps`/`pstree` to view your process tree.

---

### **Week 3: File Descriptors and System I/O**
- What is a file descriptor?
- System calls: `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`
- Duplicating FDs: `dup`, `dup2`, redirecting stdin/out
- *Lab:* Write a simple `tee` clone (copy stdin to a file and stdout).
- *Observable:* Redirect your program‚Äôs output with `<` and `>` in the shell.

---

### **Week 4: Memory and the Process Address Space**
- Stack vs. heap vs. data segment
- Dynamic memory: `malloc`, `free`, `brk`, `sbrk`, `mmap`
- Reading `/proc/self/maps`
- *Lab:* Write a C program that allocates, uses, and frees memory, then inspects its address space.
- *Observable:* Annotate your own memory map and find stack/heap/code regions.

---

### **Week 5: Signals and Signal Handling**
- What are signals? Signal numbers (`kill -l`)
- Catching and ignoring signals: `signal()`, `sigaction()`
- Common signals: `SIGINT`, `SIGSEGV`, `SIGCHLD`
- *Lab:* Write a program that handles Ctrl+C and segmentation faults.
- *Observable:* Demonstrate handling `SIGINT` (print message, exit cleanly).

---

### **Week 6: Inter-Process Communication (Pipes, FIFOs)**
- Anonymous pipes (`pipe()`)
- Named pipes (FIFOs, `mkfifo`)
- Chaining processes with pipes (e.g., implementing a simple shell pipeline)
- *Lab:* Parent writes to a pipe, child reads from it; build a one-way IPC.
- *Observable:* Pass messages between parent and child using a pipe.

---

### **Week 7: Threads and Concurrency**
- `pthread_create`, `pthread_join`
- Race conditions, mutexes, condition variables
- Data sharing and thread safety

## üìù How To Use This Syllabus

- Treat each week as a standalone module ‚Äî review, lab, observable outcome.
- Focus on code **and** analysis: always ask ‚Äúwhat did the OS do when my code ran?‚Äù
- Annotate your labs with writeups, screenshots, and lessons learned.
- Tie in to CNO/RE: after each module, note ‚Äúhow could an attacker, defender, or analyst use/misuse this?‚Äù
